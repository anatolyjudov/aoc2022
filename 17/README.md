# Weird puzzle

This solution works with the given input, but doesn't work with the test data.

Solution relies on fact that we'll get a flat cup regulary which is true with input, and it's not for test data.

Probably I was supposed to implement some clever algorithm to detect repeating sequences, but it's enough for me for now.
